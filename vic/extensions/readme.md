VIC-AMBHAS User Manual

Introduction
This documents describes the input files for the coupled VIC-AMBHAS model. AMBHAS is a 2D lateral groundwater model and is built into the image version of VIC 5.0.1. VIC calculates a groundwater recharge as a function of soil moisture and water table depth and passes this into AMBHAS. AMBHAS calculates lateral groundwater flow, groundwater baseflow and interacts with the land surface. AMBHAS feeds back the water table depth and groundwater baseflow to VIC. There is also an option of abstracting groundwater from the aquifer, specified through model input. The model can be run in a dynamic steady state, using one year of forcing data or as time-variant. 
This version of VIC will only work as the coupled version of VIC-AMBHAS, and only with the image version of VIC.
To run the standard version of VIC without the addition of groundwater, please use the version directly from the VIC repository: https://github.com/UW-Hydro/VIC.
If you make use of this model, please acknowledge Scheidegger et al, submitted, and the VIC papers: Hamman et al., 2018 (DOI:10.5194/gmd-11-3481-2018) and Liang et al., 1994 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94jd00483).


Preparation of input files
##########################

VIC input files
##########################
The VIC model inputs consists of a global parameter file, meteorological forcing files, a parameter file and a domain file.  The global parameter file is the main input file and points to the location of the parameter, forcing and domain files, as well as setting model timings and output options. The meteorological forcing file, parameter file and domain file are spatially distributed files in netcdf format. Description, structure and format of each of them is described in the VIC image driver documentation (https://vic.readthedocs.io/en/master/Documentation/Drivers/Image/Inputs/). 
The input files for the coupled VIC-AMBHAS describing the land surface, model domain, and forcing are unaltered from the original VIC input files. However, since the baseflow formulation in VIC is replaced with the groundwater recharge calculation, the parameters Ds, Dsmax, Ws and c are not used in the model, but dummy values need to be set.

AMBHAS input files
##########################
The input files for the groundwater model consist of a global parameter file, groundwater data file, initial hydraulic heads filed, and a file describing the observation points.

Global parameter file
##########################
The global parameter file specifies the model dimension, the number of rows (NROW), columns (NCOL) and time steps (NTIME).The cell size of latitudes (y), longitudes (x) are given in DLAT and DLON, and the time step in days is DT. DLAT and DLON can either be in degree or in m, however the spacing in lat/lon or km is regular.
There are several output options for the hydraulic head field to the netcdf file h_n.nc, where n is the time step.
	0: hydraulic head field is written to out every time step
	1: hydraulic head field is only written out for the last time step
	n: hydraulic head field is written out every n time steps
The model can be run in several simulation modes: 

Simulation Mode: 
  0: dynamic steady state using the forcing data of the first year and pumping of the first time step, 
  1: transient simulation
  3: dynamic steady state using the forcing data of the first year and pumping of the first year, 

As a default, the hydraulic heads for the initial conditions will be set to DEM-10. Otherwise, a hydraulic head distribution can be read in as a file if restart is set to 1. The filename and path have to be specified

It must be specified whether hydraulic conductivity in m/day or Transmissivity in m2/day is read in.

It must be specified whether the model is run as confined or unconfined model. If the model is unconfined, then hydraulic conductivity has to be read in.

It must be specified whether the grid is in m or in lat/lon. If the grid is in lat/lon, then the cell dimensions and area for each cell need to be read in gw_data.nc

The pumping flag determines whether groundwater pumping time series are read in.
  0: no pumping time series is read in 
  1: pumping time series is read in
  
A stress period for which the pumping is applied is specified as multiple of the time step DT
  
The specific yield can have one value in the soil and one value in the aquifer with a linear transition to twice the soil depth.
  0: one value of Sy
  1: Sy has one value in the soil and one in the aquifer
  
The maximum recharge from the soil to the aquifer is limited to a fraction of total available water in the layer the water table is interaction with for one time step. This improves stability within the model when the water table is close to the soil layer.

Observation boreholes
##########################
Observation boreholes can be specified, for which the hydraulic head value for every time step will be recorded.
The first line gives the number of boreholes. The subsequent lines specify a borehole name and their latitude and longitude.
